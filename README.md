# High-Write Traffic Simulation with RocksDB

This project simulates handling high-write traffic using RocksDB in Node.js. The example demonstrates asynchronous writes and batching techniques to optimize performance in write-heavy systems.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- RocksDB

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the simulation:

```bash
node src/index.js
```

## Feature
    . Asynchronous Writes: Non-blocking write operations.
    . High-Write Traffic Simulation: Simulate 10,000 write operations.
    . Batch Writes (Optional): For even better performance.


### 6. **Further Enhancements**

You can take the project further by:
- Adding **performance monitoring** to see how well the system performs under different loads.
- Implementing **data read functionality** to ensure that data is written and stored correctly.
- Exploring **compaction settings** in RocksDB to manage how data is merged over time.

This project provides a solid foundation for handling high-write traffic using asynchronous writes and RocksDB. You can build on this by exploring more advanced RocksDB features or integrating with a real-world use case.
